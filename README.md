## 📌 Project Overview
A Machine Learning system that predicts whether a loan
application will be approved or rejected based on
applicant information such as income, credit history,
loan amount, and other factors.

## ⚙️ ML Pipeline

### Phase 1: Data Loading
- Loaded dataset with 614 records and 13 columns

### Phase 2: Data Cleaning
- Filled 149 missing values using Mode and Median
- Removed duplicate records
- Dropped irrelevant Loan_ID column

### Phase 3: Preprocessing
- Treated outliers using IQR method
- Normalized numerical columns using MinMaxScaler
- Encoded categorical columns using LabelEncoder

### Phase 4: EDA
- Created 13 visualization charts
- Univariate, Bivariate and Correlation Analysis

### Phase 5: Feature Engineering
- Created Total_Income (Applicant + Coapplicant)
- Created Income_Loan_Ratio (repayment capacity)
- Created EMI (monthly payment estimate)

### Phase 6: Model Building
- Balanced data using SMOTE (422 vs 422)
- Split data 80% train / 20% test
- Trained 4 ML models

### Phase 7: Model Evaluation
- Compared all models using multiple metrics

## 🏆 Best Model
Model    : Random Forest

Accuracy : 79.88%
---

## 🔑 Key Findings
Credit History is the most important feature (25.2%)
Income to Loan Ratio is 2nd most important (12.7%)
Total Income is 3rd most important (11.3%)
Semiurban areas have highest loan approval rates
Graduates get slightly more loan approvals
Good credit history = much higher chance of approval
